This is a refactored version suggestion of the cudnn-training project https://github.com/tbennun/cudnn-training

It will not be continued. its only meant as suggestion (see pull-request https://github.com/tbennun/cudnn-training/pull/28)

instead of having all structs/helpers/... in one .cu file some additional .h files are added. (for a clearer appearance)

All further updates and current information will only be done in https://github.com/3DdeepAI/3DdeepAI/tree/3DdeepAI 

this project was forked from https://github.com/tbennun/cudnn-training
